# -Elevating-Supplier-Collaboration-for-Mutual-Growth-at-Sparkles-Inc.-General

Business Overview/Problem
Sparkles Inc. recently hired a new procurement manager, John Doe, to optimize procurement operations. He sees an opportunity to identify and partner with top suppliers to negotiate discounted deals and other incentives.

John has requested the analytics team to identify Sparkles' top suppliers based on purchase volumes, frequency of purchase, and amount spent. He needs a list of these suppliers and their contact information.

John wants to know who Sparkles' most important suppliers are so that he can negotiate better deals with them. He needs the analytics team to identify these suppliers based on how much they sell to Sparkles and how often Sparkles buys from them.

Rationale for the Project
Supplier collaboration in supply chains is essential for reducing costs, minimizing risks, and creating more resilient supply chain networks. By working together, suppliers and businesses can identify and address inefficiencies, proactively manage disruptions, and drive mutual growth.
 
Sparkles Inc. can improve its supply chain and save money by identifying its key suppliers. It can negotiate better prices, bulk purchase discounts, and stronger supplier relationships, which can lead to better reliability and fewer supply chain disruptions.
 
By knowing who its most important suppliers are, Sparkles can work with them to improve its supply chain and make it more efficient. This can lead to lower costs, better quality products, and more reliable deliveries.

Aim of the Project
Building on the foundation of Sparkles Inc.'s strong retail presence and in line with John Doe's vision, the objectives of this project are outlined as follows:
 
✓ Supplier Analysis: Dive deep into historical data to spotlight top-performing suppliers. This analysis would consider criteria such as purchase volume, frequency, and total amount spent.
 
✓ Data Extraction: After a meticulous analysis, create a list of these suppliers and extract their details from the database onto a spreadsheet for easy access and presentation.
 
✓ Stakeholder Presentation: Present John Doe with the final list, ensuring it clearly displays the suppliers' contact information and meets all of his specified requirements.
